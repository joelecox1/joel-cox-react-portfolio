            <em>You got games on your phone?</em> I do. That's how I got here, sort of. I love puzzles and problem solving, so web development is a constructive outlet for me to get some of that energy out, in a creative and lucrative way. Having worked in blue collar industries for the past decade, I am now ready to further destroy my posture working for you. I am currently undergoing a full stack (MERN specific) program through Vanderbilt University. Feel free to reach out to me via the contact section. Let's acquire this currency!
